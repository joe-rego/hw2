        <img class="rounded-xl border-8 md:flex" src="Jessica.jpg">
        <p class="mt-2">I’m from Western Mass originally and moved to the eastern part of the state to pursue a degree in Communications ​+ ​Business Administration at Merrimack College. After graduating, I ​took a different path and started working in a pastry kitchen ​while simultaneously ​starting the Professional Pastry Program at the Cambridge School of Culinary Arts. Moving to Boston was the best decision I ever made. I love this city​ — ​the food and drink scene, the sports, the people​. Pretty much everything except the parking. I collect old cookbooks, obscure cookie cutters and ramekins for dipping sauces. When I’m not at Flour​, ​you can find me roaming around the cheese section of the grocery store.</p>

        <h2 class="text-1xl text-black-500 font-semibold underline mt-2"> Joe Price: Executive sous chef</h2>
        <img class="rounded-xl border-8 md:flex" src="Joe.jpg">
        <p class="mt-2">Hi my name is Joe. I was born and raised in Stoneham, MA. and now reside in the city of Boston. Out of high school I worked at a high tech company for seven years, that career lasted until I was laid off due to the company’s downsize; best thing that could have happened. Although I love technology there has always been a strong, almost obsessive, passion for food. Being in a family of bartenders, chefs, and servers, my career naturally moved in the direction of the restaurant industry. I learned standards and the importance of attention to detail from Chris Parsons and his team at his Catch Restaurant in Winchester, MA. Right place right time, I learned proper techniques and worked with beautiful ingredients. Fast forward I was sous chef for the opening of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum’s Café G in the Fenway, and then The Local Kitchen & Drinks new Wayland expansion. Both positions afforded more opportunity to be creative with seasonal and local food. When not at Flour, my hobbies include tending to my urban garden, traveling, and hanging out with my family and friends.</p>
