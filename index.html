        <div class="md:flex">
        <p class="p-4 space-y-4">Crusty, crackling baguettes warm from the steaming oven… buttery, raisin-filled brioche shaped in a swirl and drizzled with sweet icing… silky-smooth chocolate cream pie… lemon curd cakes filled with raspberry preserves… fresh, made-to-order salads and sandwiches. Imagine enjoying a muffin still warm from the oven, made with real butter and fresh seasonal fruit, alongside a cafe latte in an oversized mug. For lunch, choose among daily specials such as bacon and caramelized onion quiche or a slice of tomato, guanciale, breadcrumb, calabrian chili pizza. Bring home a beautifully decorated birthday cake made with flourless chocolate cake layers and rich chocolate mousse. We offer buttery breakfast pastries, grand homemade cookies, luscious pies, gorgeous cakes, and sandwiches, soups, salads, and grain bowls. Everything is prepared in-house by our professional kitchen staff. Our business includes morning commuters stopping in for breakfast, area employees and neighbors enjoying lunch, friends meeting for coffee and talk, office workers seeking to satisfy their 4pm sugar craving, people picking up bread, salad, or dessert for their evening meal. Along with our quality product, our success depends on a well-trained, professional service staff. We strive to be constantly and consistently friendly, attentive, and courteous. We want each customer’s experience to be full of delight, and we focus on all aspects involved: great food, gracious service, warm atmosphere, heady aromas, and irresistible displays. We can’t wait to see you!
